# Yelp Business Dataset Analysis 

## Overall Goal:
We hope to see or prove if there is a correlation or relationship on the type of restaurants and their ratings depended on their geographical location. The process involved cleaning the dataset using pandas and graphing our findings with seaborn and matplot. We also used sklearn to predict conclusions using linear regression and SVM machine learning models.

## Requirements:
Everything can be viewed in the jupyter notebook file. Required libraries and packages can also be viewed in the requirements text file.
