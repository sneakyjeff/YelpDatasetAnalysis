# Yelp Business Dataset Analysis 

## Overall Goal:
We hope to see or prove if there is a correlation or relationship on the type of restaurants and their ratings dependent on their geographical location. The process involved cleaning the dataset using pandas and graphing our findings with seaborn and matplot. We also used sklearn to predict conclusions using linear regression and SVM machine learning models.

## Requirements:
Everything can be viewed in the YelpBusinessDataset jupyter notebook file. Might have to reload or refresh the page when trying to read YelpBusinessDataset file, the file is large and has lot of graphs. Required libraries and packages can also be viewed in the requirements text file.
